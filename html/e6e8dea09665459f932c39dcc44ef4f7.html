<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>A stock solution (0.1 mg/ml) of standard cane sugar and lactose was prepared in water: methanol (1:9) and sonicated for 10 minutes over an ultrasonic bath.</li>
<li>The solution was filtered through Whatman No. 42 filter paper and filtrate was used as sample solution.</li>
<li>A 20cm &times; 10cm HPTLC plate coated with silica gel 60 F 254 was used for analysis.</li>
<li>The samples were applied at 10 mm from the base of HPTLC plate by means of a Camag (Switzerland) Linomat V sample applicator using a syringe (100&micro;L, Hamilton, Bonaduz, Switzerland).</li>
<li>A linear calibration curve was obtained on applying the increasing concentrations of standard cane sugar and lactose in the range (200-1000 ng).</li>
<li>HPTLC analysis was performed on a computerized densitometer scanner 3, controlled by WinCATS planar chromatography manager version 1.4.4. (CAMAG, Switzerland).</li>
<li>Plate was developed to a distance of 80 mm, in a Camag twin-trough chamber with mobile phase [n-Butanol: Acetic acid: Water:: 2:1:1 (v/v)].</li>
<li>Plates were derivatized using aniline diphenylamine phosphoric acid.</li>
<li>Plates were evaluated by densitometry at 520 nm with a Camag Scanner 3 for quantification.</li>
</ul>

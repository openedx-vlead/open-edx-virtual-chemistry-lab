<p>The chromatographic profile of the sample was simple, showing urea as the main component (Fig. 1). Urea is not UV active, so the plates were derivatized using the Ehrlich&rsquo;s reagent (Fig. 2). Peak of urea was identified using the solvent system [n-propanol: Water:: 8:2 (v/v)] with the R<sub>f</sub> value of 0.74 &plusmn; 0.03 and there was no overlap with any other analyses of the sample at 440 nm (Fig. 3).</p>

<p>The linearity of the proposed method was confirmed in the range of 5-30 &micro;g of standard urea. A linear regression of the data points for standard urea is resulted in a calibration curve with the equation Y=25.044 + 24.301x [regression coefficient (r<sup>2</sup>) = 0.99884, standard deviation (S.D.) = 2.77%] (Fig. 4). Urea content in milk samples were calculated and depicted in Table 1.<br /><br /></p>

<p>The linearity, accuracy in terms of recovery % and precision was considered for the method. Validation of the method at three concentration levels was carried out by the standard recovery formula returned a mean of 92.24%. Precision (repeatability) was determined by running a minimum of four analyses and the coefficient of variability was found to be 2.892 %. The limit of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) was found to be 0.37 and 1.13 &micro;g respectively.</p>

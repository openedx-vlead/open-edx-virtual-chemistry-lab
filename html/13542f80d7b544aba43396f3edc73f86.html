<p><strong>(b) Qualitative and quantitative analysis of capsaicin</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A stock solution of capsaicin was prepared by dissolving capsaicin (5 mg) in methanol (5 ml) in a volumetric flask. The capsaicin samples (extracted from dried Red chili/ Green chili/ Capsicum) were dissolved in ethanol and sonicated for 8 hours.</li>
<li>The solution was filtered through Whatman No. 41 filter paper and filtrate was used as sample solution.</li>
<li>The resulting solution was then distilled and distillate was dissolved in methanol.</li>
<li>A 20cm &times; 10cm aluminium backed HPTLC plate coated with silica gel<br /> 60 F<sub> </sub>254 (E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was used for analysis.</li>
<li>The samples were applied at 10 mm from the base of HPTLC plate by means of a Camag (Switzerland) Linomat V sample applicator using a syringe (100&micro;L, Hamilton, Bonaduz, Switzerland).</li>
<li>HPTLC analysis was performed on a computerized densitometer scanner 3, controlled by winCATS planar chromatography manager version 1.4.4. (CAMAG, Switzerland)..</li>
<li>Plate was developed to a distance of 80 mm, in a Camag twin-trough chamber with mobile phase CHCl&not;3: MeOH: Acetic acid: 9.5:0.5:0.1 (v/v/v).</li>
<li>Plates were evaluated by densitometry at 282 nm with a Camag Scanner 3 for quantification.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>To develop Teaching/Learning Modules for advanced separation Techniques: High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography for Under Graduate and Post Graduate students.<br /><br /></li>
<li>To inculcate in depth knowledge of theoretical and practical concepts of Chromatography, inducing confidence in the students for better experimental skill.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Simulation based on the change in Rf values under different experimental conditions: Polarity of mobile phase, Nature of stationary phase (cellulose/Silica gel/Alumina), Saturation time of solvent chamber, pH (Acidic/Basic) etc.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Virtual demonstration of the experiment for multi users.</li>

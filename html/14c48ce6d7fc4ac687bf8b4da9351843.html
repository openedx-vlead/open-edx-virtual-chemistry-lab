<h2>Observation</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The chromatographic profile of the sample was simple, showing cholesterol as the main component. Peak of cholesterol was identified using the solvent system [n-Hexane: Diethyl ether: MeOH:: 5:2:0.5 (v/v)] with the R<sub>f</sub> value of 0.37 &plusmn; 0.01 and there was no overlap with any other analyses of the sample at 200 nm (Fig.1).</p>

<p>The linearity of the proposed method was confirmed in the range of 100-700 ng of standard cholesterol. A linear regression of the data points for standard cholesterol is resulted in a calibration curve with the equation <em>Y</em>=644.436 + 652.7908<em>x </em>[regression coefficient (<em>r<sup>2</sup></em>) = 0.99831, standard deviation (S.D.) = 2.13%] (Fig. 2). Cholesterol content in edible oils was found to be in the range of 150-710 ng/spot selected for study (Table 1).</p>

<p>The linearity, accuracy in terms of recovery % and precision was considered for the method. Validation of the method at three concentration levels was carried out by the standard recovery formula [9] returned a mean of 90.66%. Precision (repeatability) was determined by running a minimum of four analyses and the coefficient of variability was found to be 1.662 %. The limit of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) was found to be 10 and 32 ng respectively.</p>

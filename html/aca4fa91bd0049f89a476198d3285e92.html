<p class="meta"></p>
<p>Separation as applied to chemical systems means to part or to divide a homogeneous mixture or mass into its components, individual units or even into elements. Separation may be performed by making use of various methods and techniques which are based on sound fundamentals chemical and physical properties. Many separation procedures are very complex and costly affair, however, simple methods are also available for separation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The area of separation has experienced a rapid growth in recent years. Of all the different types of separation methods, Chromatography has the unique position of being applicable to all types of problems in all areas in science. It is used for the separation of a mixture of components brought about by the dynamic partition or distribution of dissolved or dispersed material between two immiscible phases. Among the various chromatographic techniques.</p>

<p>Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) is most popular and widely used for separation. Recent developments have lead to the improvement in various operations involved in conventional TLC. The advanced High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography (HPTLC) technique has resulted into improved performance in terms of separation and high resolution in quantitative analysis.</p>

<p>HPTLC occupies important place in theory and practical syllabus of UG and PG level and is widely used in various pharmaceutical, forensic, herbal, cosmetic, environmental, food Industries etc. Expertise in HPTLC technique provides bright chances to the students to get a job as analyst in various R&amp;D sectors. HPTLC instrument generally is not available in college level research laboratories, therefore, Virtual demonstration of experiments based on HPTLC would provide a real Lab view and familiarization with HPTLC.</p>

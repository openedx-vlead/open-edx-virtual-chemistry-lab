<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>A stock solution (3 mg/ml) of standard urea was prepared in water: MeOH (1:9) and sonicated for 10 minutes over an ultrasonic bath. </li>
<li>The solution was filtered through Whatman No. 41 filter paper and filtrate was used as sample solution.</li>
<li>A 20cm &times; 10cm HPTLC plate coated with silica gel 60 F 254 and alumina60 F 254 (E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was used for analysis.</li>
<li>The samples were applied at 10 mm from the base of HPTLC plate by means of a Camag (Switzerland) Linomat V sample applicator using a syringe (100&micro;L, Hamilton, Bonaduz, Switzerland).</li>
<li>A linear calibration curve was obtained on applying the increasing concentration of standard urea in the range (5-30 &micro;g). </li>
<li>HPTLC analysis was performed on a computerized densitometer scanner 3, controlled by WinCATS planar chromatography manager version 1.4.4. (CAMAG, Switzerland).</li>
<li>Plate was developed to a distance of 80 mm, in a Camag twin-trough chamber with mobile phase [n-propanol: Water:: 8:2 (v/v)]. </li>
<li>Plates were derivatized using Ehrlich&rsquo;s reagent.</li>
<li>Plates were evaluated by densitometry at 440 nm with a Camag Scanner 3 for quantification.</li>

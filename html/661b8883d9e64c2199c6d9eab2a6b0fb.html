<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>A stock solution of standard cholesterol was prepared by dissolving cholesterol(0.05 mg/ml) in toluene and sonicated for 10 minutes over an ultrasonic bath.</li>
<li>Edible oils were mixed with toluene and sonicated for 30 minutes for proper mixing.</li>
<li>The solution was filtered through Whatman No. 41 filter paper and filtrate was used as sample solution.</li>
<li>A 20cm &times; 10cm HPTLC plate coated with silica gel 60 F<sub> </sub>254 and alumina60 F<sub> </sub>254 (E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was used for analysis.</li>
<li>The samples were applied at 10 mm from the base of HPTLC plate by means of a Camag (Switzerland) Linomat V sample applicator using a syringe (100&micro;L, Hamilton, Bonaduz, Switzerland).</li>
<li>A linear calibration curve was obtained on applying the increasing concentration of standard amino acids in the range (200-1400 ng).</li>
<li>HPTLC analysis was performed on a computerized densitometer scanner 3, controlled by WinCATS planar chromatography manager <em>version 1.4.4.</em> (CAMAG, Switzerland).</li>
<li>Plate was developed to a distance of 80 mm, in a Camag twin-trough chamber with mobile phase [n-Hexane: Diethyl ether: MeOH:: 5:2:0.5 (v/v)].</li>
<li>Plates were evaluated by densitometry at 200 nm with a Camag Scanner 3 for quantification.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>(b) Qualitative and quantitative analysis of caffeine </strong></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>A stock solution of caffeine was prepared by dissolving caffeine (1 mg) in methanol (100 ml) in a volumetric flask. The solution was sonicated for 10 minutes over an ultrasonic bath, to obtain a homogenous solution.Similarly, the crystalline caffeine samples (extracted from tea/coffee) were dissolved in methanol and then sonicated for 10 min.</li>
<li>The solution was filtered through Whatman No. 41 filter paper and filtrate was used as sample solution.</li>
<li>A 20cm &times; 10cm aluminium backed HPTLC plate coated with silica gel<br /> 60 F<sub> </sub>254 (E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was used for analysis. They were pre-washed with methanol and dried in an oven at 65<sup>o</sup>C for 10 minutes.</li>
<li>The samples were applied at 10 mm from the base of HPTLC plate by means of a Camag (Switzerland) Linomat V sample applicator using a syringe (100&micro;L, Hamilton, Bonaduz, Switzerland).</li>
<li>A linear calibration curve was obtained on applying the increasing concentration of standard caffeine in the range (20-140 ng). Extracted samples (4.8 and 200 &micro;g) from tea and coffee respectively were also loaded on the same plate.</li>
<li>HPTLC analysis was performed on a computerized densitometer scanner 3, controlled by <em>winCATS</em> planar chromatography manager <em>version 1.4.4.</em> (CAMAG, Switzerland).</li>
<li>Plate was developed to a distance of 80 mm, in a Camag twin-trough chamber with mobile phase toluene: acetone, 4:1 (<em>v/v</em>).</li>
<li>Plates were evaluated by densitometry at 275 nm with a Camag Scanner 3 for quantification.</li>
</ul>
